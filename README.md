This repo contains the open source code of the Atsign's No Ports suite. Check out our product site at [noports.com](https://noports.com).

* [sshnoports](./packages/sshnoports) provides a way to ssh to a remote linux host/device without that
device or the client having any open ports (not even 22) on external interfaces.
